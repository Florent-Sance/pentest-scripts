 - Raspberry Pi
 - Small screen (2.2" Serial SPI TFT LCD Display Module 240x320 Chip ILI9340C PCB Adapter SD Card or 2.2" 18-bit color TFT LCD display with microSD card breakout - ILI9340)
 
Software needed:
- Rasbpian with SPI support activated
- feh
- Screen configurated

Configuration (as root):
 - Enable SPI: with raspi-config or del/comment this line: <blacklist spi-bcm2708> from /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
 - Reboot
 - Install RPI Firmware: sudo REPO_URI=https://github.com/notro/rpi-firmware rpi-update
 - Reboot (again)
 - sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruit22a verbose=1
 - Add to /etc/modules: <fbtft dma>, <fbtft_device name=adafruit22a> and <verbose=0>
 - Add to /boot/cmdline.txt, at the end of the line: <fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:VGA8x8>
 - Edit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf: change <Option "fdev" "/dev/fb0"> by <Option "fdev" "/dev/fb1">
 - Install feh : apt-get install feh

How to run:
 - Put you images in ./images folder
 - Prepare something to trace the test (a camera)
 - Put the device in front of the screen (using a car holder for example)
 - Plug the device to the Raspberry in USB (needed to wake up the screen)
